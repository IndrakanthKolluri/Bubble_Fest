# Background Image Unification Plan

## Goal: 
Make ScroolingImages, Stages, and BuubleFestImages components share the same collage7.jpg background with identical blur effect

## Steps:
1. [ ] Update ScroolingImages.jsx to use collage7.jpg with blur(8px) brightness(0.6)
2. [ ] Update BuubleFestImages.jsx to use collage7.jpg with blur(8px) brightness(0.6)
3. [ ] Verify Stages.jsx already uses collage7.jpg with blur(8px) brightness(0.6)
4. [ ] Test that all components render correctly with consistent background

## Current Status:
- Stages.jsx: ✅ Already uses collage7.jpg with correct styling
- ScroolingImages.jsx: ❌ Needs update (currently uses collage4.jpg)
- BuubleFestImages.jsx: ❌ Needs update (currently uses bubblefest1.jpg)
